## Temperature and Light Control System using Embedded C language and PIC18f43k22 microcontroller

## Abstract
The Temperature and light control system (TLCS) is a locally designed microcontroller-borne electronic circuit system capable of monitoring and controlling the temperature of a thermally isolated enclosure or chamber provided the heating or cooling source which is electrically powered. This system also monitors the house porch light system based on the light intensity of the surroundings and controls the lamp to be switched on and off.Monitoring and automation are achieved with the aid of a Temperature sensor, LDR sensor, Microcontroller IC, Analogue-to-Digital Converter (ADC), Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) unit, a Switching circuit, and other essential components. The Microcontroller has been programmed to monitor and control instantaneous temperature values received from a temperature sensor to control the heating and cooling system and from the instantaneous light, values received from an LDR sensor control the house porch lamp.

The software used are MPLAB and Proteus for Simulaton.
